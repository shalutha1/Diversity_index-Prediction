# Diversity_index-Prediction
In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model that predicts the diversity index of 
fish species based on various factors, including morphological and environmental characteristics. 
Using the provided dataset, the workflow will follow a structured approach, starting with data 
preprocessing, exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and relationships within the data. 
This will be followed by feature engineering and selection to enhance the predictive power of the 
model.
